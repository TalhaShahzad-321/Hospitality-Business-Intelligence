# Hospitality-Business-Intelligence
Happy to share my latest dashboard project, developed to provide the hospitality industry with actionable insights for enhanced decision-making and performance tracking.

Problem Statement: In a competitive market, it is crucial for hotels to optimize their revenue and operational efficiency. This dashboard aims to empower hotel management with key performance metrics to drive better business outcomes.

🛠️ Toolkit: Power BI, MS Excel, Power BI Service, DAX
📊 Datasets: CSV files

I created a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that offers valuable insights into the revenue generation and performance metrics of hotels.

💡 Key Metrics:

RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Average revenue per available room, regardless of occupancy.
Occupancy%: Percentage of occupied rooms out of available rooms.
ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average rate at which rooms are sold.
SRN (Sellable Room Night): Number of rooms available for sale.
DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Night): Daily basis of SRN.
URN (Utilize Room Night): Total number of rooms occupied or sold multiplied by the number of nights.
BRN (Booked Room Night): Total number of room nights reserved by guests.
No-Shows: Number of booked rooms not occupied by guests.
Realization: Ratio of URN to BRN.
🔍 Insights:

RevPAR and ADR: Both can be equal when occupancy is 100%.
Occupancy Analysis: Understand daily, weekly, and monthly trends.
Revenue Generation: Identify high and low revenue periods.
Cancellation and No-Shows: Track cancellation rates and no-show percentages.
Booking Trends: Analyze booking patterns by platform and over time.
My Learnings:

📈 Key business metrics in the hotel industry, such as RevPAR, occupancy%, ADR, and realization%.
